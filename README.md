## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore the feasibility of adding servos to preexisting designed DIY prosthetics to help enhance user experience.
Traditional suspension system only allows a open-close hand grip, by using individual motors/servos. We can do more variety of finger controls.

## Method
Using Arduino board with servos of any choice, I implemented the system to the 3D printed prosthetic arm designed by @Shira on Thingiverse. [YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWL13vvi94s&feature=youtu.be). There's also an organization that helps to shift this movement for kids with missing fingers [Enabling the future](http://enablingthefuture.org/)

## Future Exploration
Future exploration would primarily focus on the types of input to control this hand. EMG based controller would be one of the most popular choice. By using upper limb muscles, we can couple with smarter algorithms (Machine Learning) to understand what combination of muscles governs what types of finger movements. In addition, I could also explore other possibility such as voice-command, gesture recognitions...and so on...
